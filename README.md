# LVIS-DEBUG
improvement for simplicity of debug 
1. fix a bug in eval.py: dtype=np.float -> np.float64(for numpy>1.20.0)
2. only eval part of dataset to save time with img_ids

LVIS (pronounced ‘el-vis’): is a new dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation.
When complete, it will feature more than 2 million high-quality instance segmentation masks for over 1200 entry-level object categories in 164k images. The LVIS API enables reading and interacting with annotation files, visualizing annotations, and evaluating results.

## LVIS v1.0

For this release, we have annotated 159,623 images (100k train, 20k val, 20k test-dev, 20k test-challenge). Release v1.0 is publicly available at [LVIS website](http://www.lvisdataset.org) and will be used in the second LVIS Challenge to be held at Joint COCO and LVIS Workshop at ECCV 2020.

## Setup
You can setup a virtual environment and then install `lvisapi` using pip:

```bash
python3 -m venv env               # Create a virtual environment
source env/bin/activate           # Activate virtual environment

# install COCO API. COCO API requires numpy to install. Ensure that you installed numpy.
pip install 'git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI'
# install LVIS API
pip install lvis
# Work for a while ...
deactivate  # Exit virtual environment
```

You can also clone the repo first and then do the following steps inside the repo:
```bash
python3 -m venv env               # Create a virtual environment
source env/bin/activate           # Activate virtual environment

# install COCO API. COCO API requires numpy to install. Ensure that you installed numpy.
pip install 'git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI'
# install LVIS API
pip install .
# test if the installation was correct
python test.py
# Work for a while ...
deactivate  # Exit virtual environment
```

The code is a re-write of PythonAPI for [COCO](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi).
The core functionality is the same with LVIS specific changes.
